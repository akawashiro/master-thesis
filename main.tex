% Merits of multi-stage programming

Multi-stage programming is a programming paradigm that enables genaration of
code and evaluation of code at run-time. For instance, MetaOCaml, which is
a well-known multi-stage programming language, supports quasi-quotation and
cross-stage persistence for manipulation of code fragments as first-class
values and an evaluation construct for execution of programs dynamically
generated by code manipulation. A significant merit of multi-stage
programming is utilizing run-time information for code generation. For
example, we can generate an efficient vector sum function for arbitrary
fixed-length vectors by unrolling loops.

% Problems of multi-stage programming

However, such optimization may cause severe problems because specialized
functions only can be used for restricted arguments. In the case of vector
addition function, the generated function is specialized for the given
length, and we must use it vectors of the correct length. Otherwise, the
function can access outside of vectors because the loop-unrolled code never
checks the boundaries of vectors.

% Our solution for the problem

To resolve the above problem, we study a dependently typed extension of a
multi-stage programming language \`a la MetaOCaml. Dependent types bring to
multi-stage programming enforcement of strong invariants---beyond simple
type safety---on the behavior of dynamically generated code. In the case of
vector sum function, the length of arguments is restricted only to the
desired one by dependent types. However, extending multi-stage programming
with dependent types is non-trivial because such a type system must
integrate stages of types, which is the number of surrounding quotations.

% Our contibution

To rigorously study properties of such an extension, we develop \LMD, which is
an extension of typed calculus \LTP proposed by Hanada and Igarashi with
dependent types, and prove its properties, including preservation,
confluence, strong normalization for full reduction, and progress for
staged reduction.  Furthermore, we design algorithmic typing to implement a
type-checker and prove its equivalence to the original typing. 

% Following sentence may be too technical.

    % Motivated by code generators that generate code whose type depends on a
    % value from outside of the quotations, we argue the significance of CSP in
    % dependently typed multi-stage programming and certain type equivalences
    % that are not directly derived from reduction rules.
