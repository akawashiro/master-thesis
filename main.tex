% Merits of multi-stage programming and its problem

    Multi-stage programming is a programming paradigm that enables genaration of
    code and evaluation of code at run-time. For instance, MetaOCaml, which is
    a well-known multi-stage programming language, supports quasi-quotation and
    cross-stage persistence for manipulation of code fragments as first-class
    values and an evaluation construct for execution of programs dynamically
    generated by this code manipulation. One of famous applications of
    multi-stage programming is to utilize run-time information for code
    generation, e.g. run-time specialization. For example, we can generate an
    efficient vector sum function for arbitary length by unrolling loops with
    run-time code generation. However, such optimization may causes serious
    problems because specialized functions only can used for restricted
    arguments. In case of vector addition function, the generated function is
    specialized for the given length and we must not use it vectors of other
    length.

% Our solution for the problem

To resolve the above problem, we study a dependently typed extension of a
    multi-stage programming language \`a la MetaOCaml. We expect that dependent
    types bring to multi-stage programming enforcement of strong
    invariant---beyond simple type safety---on the behavior of dynamically
    generated code. For example, in case of vector sum function, we can
    restrict their length only to the desired one by dependent types. However,
    an extension of multi-stage programming is not trivial because such a type
    system would have to take stages of types---roughly speaking, the number of
    surrounding quotations---into account.

% Our contibution

To rigorously study properties of such an extension, we develop \LMD, which is
    an extension of Hanada and Igarashi's typed calculus \LTP with dependent
    types, and prove its properties, including preservation, confluence, strong
    normalization for full reduction, and progress for staged reduction. In
    addition to regular typing, we designed algorithmic typing of \LMD in order
    to implement a type-checking algorithm, and we proved its soundness and
    completeness, which means it is equivalent to regular typing. Motivated by
    code generators that generate code whose type depends on a value from
    outside of the quotations, we argue the significance of cross-stage
    persistence in dependently typed multi-stage programming and certain type
    equivalences that are not directly derived from reduction rules.
